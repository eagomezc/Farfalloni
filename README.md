# Retrotransposon App 
Web-based application for the identification of Retrotransposon in human genomes. 

This project was part of my task to achieve our master's degree in Bioinformatics. 

Available documentation to guide you through the use of this application can be found in the [Documentation section](https://github.com/eagomezc/Retrotransposon_app/tree/master/Documentation)
