List:

1. Create_database.py now in 2.7, runs more quickly, however, still takes a bit of time to generate a database due to the amount of data in the raw data files

2. Create_database.py, raw data files must be in the same path that the script is run from to generate the database

3. Database interaction with flask is underway, should be compeleted soon. Soonish.
